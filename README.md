# Array exercise
### pre-requisites
Node 12.x or later

Before testing, run `npm ci`

### TODOS
`/src/array-functions.ts` contains empty lodash like array functions to be implemented

Implement these functions and verify that they work correctly by running `npm run test`

Make all the test green, and you are a true JavaScript guru!

--------

### Hint

If you want to watch tests only for a spesific function, run `npm run test <function>`. For-example: `npm run test flatMap`

--------

#### If you encounter test do not work correctly or are not sufficient, please submit a pull-request 🙏
